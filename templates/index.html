                        &nbsp;&nbsp; Reviews are essential means of knowing the performance of a product. 
                        In this project, I have created a model that predicts the score of a review based on the text. 
                        This sentiment analysis model classifies the text into 1 to 5, based on the sentiment behind the review. 
                        For example, "Nice product" usually means a score of 5 and “Poor quality” usually means a score of 1.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; The model was trained using the 
                        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews">Amazon reviews dataset</a>, 
                        which contains around 5 lakh reviews. Since there was a class imbalance, I did undersampling to balance the classes. 
                        I used the BERT model and a linear layer at the end. Therefore, for word embedding, I used the BERT tokenizer.
                         The parameters of the BERT model were frozen during the training process to avoid computational complexity. 
                         The test accuracy turned out to be 47.4%, much greater than the random case (20%).

                        <br><br>
                        The codes for training and deployment are attached below:
=======
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; IPL is one of the most popular cricket leagues in the world.  In this project, I have developed and deployed a Machine
                        Learning model for predicting the powerplay scores of a particular innings of a particular match, using past history of ipl matches.
                        Given some information about the match (like venue, batting and bowling teams, no. of players who batted in powerplay, no. of players who bowled in powerplay,etc)
                        , the model can predict the number of runs scored by the batting team during the powerplay. 
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; The dataset available contains ball-by-ball information, hence I have performed the required preprocessing to extract the exact variables that can be used by our model.
                        I have tried different ML algorithms from linear regression to xgboost in this project. Github link to the codes used in the project (both for development and deployment) is provided below.
